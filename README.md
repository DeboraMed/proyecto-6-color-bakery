# Color Bakery
### App Idea
The application I’m going to develop, **ColorBakery** , is about colors, searching for color palettes given a base color, and having the option to obtain the most representative colors of an image that the user could upload. Its use and utility are mainly focused on artists, web developers, UI UX designers, and anyone interested in color from a practical perspective.

Project Description: The project aims to be practical, facilitating the user’s use of colors, ranges, and palettes to assist in design.

Planned Features: The application will feature a color search engine, where by entering the HEX or RGB code of the color we will have the possibility to search for “Palettes” based on it.
- **Option 1:** It will also offer the possibility to use an image (jpg, png) to obtain the most representative colors of it.
- **Option 2:** Task/project manager where you can associate a color palette (or several) with a project.
- **Other ideas:** Have a collection where you can save favorites without logging in to local storage, have a random feature. In addition, the application will include a login, a profile page, and a contact form.

### Technology to be used 
In addition to Vue, I will use some color library to obtain the chromatic ranges. And as API, I will use **TheColorAPI* and the library **ColorThief***.

### Target Audience:
As I mentioned earlier, the target audience for my application is mainly people who work with color, web designers, graphic designers, illustrators, etc. Also, anyone who needs to do a specific design customization job can use it to get the most suitable colors and choose the range.
